# Lens App Parity Rubric

Per the v3 plan at `/root/.claude/plans/well-let-s-make-it-stateless-comet.md`,
each Concord lens is a free clone of the leader paid app in its
domain. This document is the source of truth for **which leader app
shadows which lens** and **what core workflows must be present** for
that lens to count as "full app parity."

It drives:
- Phase 2 sweep sequencing (lowest % complete first)
- The visual-identity gate (does the Concord lens look like its
  leader app, or like another Concord lens?)
- The close gate (every lens ≥ 80% of its leader-app workflow target,
  heavyweights ≥ 70%)

## How to read this doc

- **Leader app** — the paid app or category-leading product the lens
  shadows. If multiple apps split the category, pick the one whose
  UX language we want to match.
- **Core workflows** — the 3–7 things the user expects to be able to
  do in that app's domain. Numbered for sweep tracking. Each becomes
  ~1 mounted UI panel or sub-route in the Concord lens.
- **Panels mounted** — current count of bespoke surfaces in the
  Concord lens that map to a core workflow. Updated after each PR.
- **% complete** — `panels mounted / target × 100`. Drives sequencing.
- **Notes** — sequencing hints, known gaps, refactor debt.

## Status legend

- ✅ `done`     — all workflows mounted with real data
- 🚧 `partial`  — at least one workflow mounted
- ⬜ `empty`    — backend exists, no leader-app-specific UI yet
- ⛔ `no-backend` — needs new `server/domains/<name>.js` first
- ❓ `tbd`      — leader-app target not yet authored (audit pending)

## Tier 4 — Trade-calc cluster (each one its own contractor app)

Per the v3 plan: NOT a shared CalcPanel. Each contractor app has its
own visual identity, charts, and reference tables.

| Lens | Leader app | Core workflows | Mounted | % | Status |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `plumbing` | **PlumbCalc Pro** | Pipe sizer (Sch-40), water heater sizer, drain slope calc, fixture supply calc | 4 of 4 | 100% | ✅ done |

## Tier 5 — Session-loop lenses (each shadowing a real session app)

| Lens | Leader app | Core workflows | Mounted | % | Status |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `meditation` | **Calm / Headspace** | Track picker, minimal player, streak ring, ambient color, journal | ❓ | — | ❓ tbd (no clear lens) |

| `sports` | **ESPN Fantasy + Strava** | Activity log, league standings, training plan, gear tracker | 0 of 4 | 0% | ⬜ empty |

## Tier 6 — Backend-creation lenses (Phase 4)

UI sketches exist but `server/domains/<name>.js` does not. Backend
first, then leader-app-shaped UI.

| Lens | Leader app | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `observe` | **Datadog** | ⛔ no-backend |
| `ops` | **PagerDuty** | ⛔ no-backend |
| `wellness` | **Whoop** | ⛔ no-backend |
| `productivity` | **Todoist** | ⛔ no-backend |
| `cri` | tbd | ⛔ no-backend |

## Tier 7 — Concord-native lenses (no external leader app)

These are domain-native to Concord and don't shadow a paid app. Target
panel count is a heuristic 3–5 covering create / inspect / network /
admin actions.

`admin`, `affect`, `all`, `alliance`, `anon`, `answers`, `app-maker`,
`ar`, `attention`, `audit` (uses Bench/GRC patterns), `billing`,
`black-market`, `board`, `bounties`, `bridge`, `byo-keys`,
`chem` (lab notebook), `cognition`, `cognitive-replay`, `collab`,
`command-center`, `commonsense`, `cooking` (recipes/meal-plan),
`council` (governance), `creator` (creator-economy dashboard),
`custom`, `deities`, `desert`, `disputes`, `dreams`, `dtus`,
`dx-platform`, `eco`, `education`, `emergency-services`,
`engineering`, `entity`, `ethics`, `event-timeline`, `events`,
`expedition-journal`, `experience`, `export`, `federation`,
`feed`, `film-studios`, `food` (recipes/meal-plan/POS),
`forge` (template generator — exists), `fork`, `fractal`,
`gallery`, `game`, `game-design`, `genesis`, `ghost-tracker`,
`global`, `goals`, `goddess`, `graph`, `home-improvement` (DIY),
`hr` (BambooHR-shape), `hypothesis`, `import`, `inference`,
`ingest`, `inheritance` (legal+IP), `insurance` (policy mgmt),
`integrations`, `invariant`, `lab`, `lattice`, `layout.tsx` (NOT A LENS),
`law` (vs `legal` — TBD), `law-enforcement`, `legacy`, `loading.tsx` (NOT A LENS),
`lock`, `logistics`, `maker`, `manufacturing`, `market`/`markets`,
`marketing` (HubSpot-shape), `math`, `mental-health`, `mentorship`,
`mesh`, `message`, `meta`, `metacognition`, `metalearning`,
`ml`, `neuro`, `news`, `offline`, `organ`, `paper`, `personas`,
`pharmacy`, `photography`, `platform`, `podcast`, `poetry`,
`privacy`, `projects`, `psyops`, `quantum`, `questmarket`,
`queue`, `realestate`, `repos`, `resonance`, `retail`, `robotics`,
`root`, `sandbox`, `schema`, `self`, `sentinel`, `settings`,
`sim`, `society`, `sponsorship`, `staking`, `sub-worlds`,
`suffering`, `supplychain`, `sync`, `system`, `telecommunications`,
`temporal`, `tick`, `timeline`, `tools`, `tournaments`, `trades`,
`transfer`, `understanding`, `veterinary` (vs `pets`),
`vote`, `wallet`, `world-creator`, `worldmodel`

**Action**: as each Tier 7 lens enters the sweep, author its row
in-line (above) — don't pre-fill speculatively. Default target = 3
panels (create / inspect / share or similar) if no clear leader app.

## Progress tracking

| Tier | Lenses | Avg % complete | Updated |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Tier 1 (active) | 11 | 73% | 2026-05-16 |
| Tier 2 (heavyweights) | 10 | 53% | 2026-05-16 |
| Tier 3 (reference/utility) | ~36 | ~28% | 2026-05-16 |
| Tier 4 (trade calcs) | 8 | 100% | 2026-05-16 |
| Tier 5 (session loops) | 5 | 0% | 2026-05-16 |
| Tier 6 (backend-creation) | 5 | 0% | 2026-05-16 |
| Tier 7 (Concord-native) | ~150 | tbd | 2026-05-16 |

**Close gate:** every Tier-1 to Tier-6 lens ≥ 80% (heavyweights ≥ 70%).
Tier 7 lenses: target authored + ≥ 80% on the authored target.

## Sweep priority (Phase 2 sequencing)

PR order, lowest % complete in each tier first:

1. ~~**Tier 4 (trade calcs)**~~ — ✅ all 8 lenses at 100% (closed 2026-05-16,
   32 bespoke widgets across plumbing / electrical / hvac / carpentry /
   welding / masonry / construction / landscaping).
2. **Path-A pivot — action surfaces on non-trade Tier-1 lenses.** The
   leader apps for `atlas`, `pets`, `automotive`, `calendar`,
   `environment`, `history`, `materials`, `ocean`, `security`,
   `services`, `energy` aren't calc suites — they're action apps. Each
   already has calc/reference panels mounted. Next move: layer
   leader-app-shaped *actions* on top (mint DTUs, send messages, kick
   agents, post to federation, schedule jobs). One action-panel PR
   per lens, in the order: `services` (29% → 43%+ first because
   booking+reminders are pure actions), then `atlas`, `calendar`,
   `pets`, then the rest.
3. **Tier 1 finish-the-job (calc gaps)** — push `materials` (43%),
   `ocean` (43%), `security` (43%), `atlas` (57%) up to 80%+ once
   action surfaces land.
4. **Tier 3 zero-coverage** — `debate`, `parenting`, `philosophy`,
   `reasoning`, `reflection`, `science`, `thread` (all 0%).
5. **Tier 5 (session loops)** — 5 lenses, all 0%, each shadowing a
   well-known leader (Anki / Calm / MasterClass / Hevy / Strava).
6. **Tier 2 heavyweight #1** — `kingdoms` (UI empty, schema fully done;
   highest ROI heavyweight).
7. **Tier 6 backend-creation** — `observe`, `ops`, `wellness`,
   `productivity`. Each: build domain + 3 panels.
8. **Tier 3 partial pushes** + remaining Tier 2 heavyweights interleaved.
9. **Tier 7** — lens-by-lens authoring as the sweep reaches each.

## Visual-identity gate (per the v3 plan)

For every lens PR, the reviewer must answer: **"Does this look like
the leader app, or like another Concord lens?"** If the answer is
"another Concord lens," redesign. The leader-app column above is the
reference target.

## Session-state snapshot

- 12 PRs landed 2026-05-16 (#737–#747). Atlas, pets, calendar fully
  retrofitted to real DTUs. 9-panel batch retrofit stripped seed
  defaults. Substrate-wide seed strip across 13 lens pages. ux-suite
  mock showcase → real-home directory.
- Tier 1 average % went from ~10% (start of session) to 65% (end).
- Tier 4 trade-calc cluster cleared 2026-05-16 (PRs #749–#756): 32
  bespoke widgets across 8 contractor-app suites (PlumbCalc Pro / NEC
  Code Calc / Manual J / Sawpipes / Lincoln WPS / Mason Stuff App /
  Procore-lite / Pro Landscape). No CalcPanel, no shared shells —
  each lens its own visual identity per the v3 path-A decision tree.
- **Action-surface pivot landed 2026-05-16** (4 commits, this session):
  calendar EventActionRail + services BookingActionDock/EndOfDayClose
  + atlas PlaceShareSheet + pets PetActionDrawer. Each lens now DOES
  things (mints DTUs, sends DMs, publishes to federation, kicks
  agents, schedules jobs) on top of its existing compute panels — the
  v3 path-A action-app classification. All side-effects wire
  already-built backends; no new server code. Lift: calendar 86→100%,
  services 29→67%, atlas 57→75%, pets 71→88%.
- This rubric authored 2026-05-16 as Phase 1 deliverable per the v3
  plan. Replaces `docs/LENS_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md` from PR #723 (which
  used the buggy detector that under-counted wiring).
