## What This Is

Concord Cognitive Engine is a cognitive operating system — a knowledge platform with 175 domain lenses, four parallel LLM brains, a self-compressing knowledge substrate (DTUs), a creator economy with perpetual royalties, a seven-layer mesh network, and a 3D civilization simulator (Concordia). Live at concord-os.org. 1.3M+ lines, one developer.

## Commands

### Backend (`server/`)
```bash
npm run dev          # node --watch server.js (hot reload)
npm start            # node server.js (production)
npm test             # node --test tests/**/*.test.js
npm run test:watch   # watch mode
npm run test:coverage
node --test --test-name-pattern="<pattern>" tests/path/to/file.test.js  # single test
npm run lint         # eslint
npm run lint:fix
npm run migrate      # apply pending DB migrations
npm run migrate:status

npm run smoke        # smoke test script
```

### Frontend (`concord-frontend/`)
```bash
npm run dev          # next dev
npm run build        # runs prophet-check pre-build, then next build
npm run lint
npm run type-check   # tsc --noEmit
npm run test         # vitest (watch)
npm run test:run     # vitest run (CI)
npm run validate-routes    # check route/lens manifest consistency

```

### Full stack (Docker)
```bash
docker-compose up           # starts backend + frontend + 4 Ollama instances
./setup.sh                  # first-time: deps + data dirs + .env + migrations
./startup.sh                # bare metal startup helper
```

### Environment variables
The server requires `JWT_SECRET` in production. Without it, a random secret is generated (sessions don't survive restart). `DB_PATH` defaults to `server/data/concord.db`. `PORT` defaults to 5050. `CONCORD_NO_LISTEN=true` prevents the server from binding a port (used in tests). Five Ollama URLs: `BRAIN_CONSCIOUS_URL` (11434), `BRAIN_SUBCONSCIOUS_URL` (11435), `BRAIN_UTILITY_URL` (11436), `BRAIN_REPAIR_URL` (11437), `BRAIN_VISION_URL` (11438 — LLaVA).

**Heap & cap tuning** (32GB-deployment defaults — override on smaller boxes):
- `MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE=32768` and start node with `--max-old-space-size=32768`. Keep both in sync; the memory-pressure watchdog reads the env var.
- `CONCORD_MAX_SHADOWS` (default 50000) — cap for `STATE.shadowDtus`.
- `CONCORD_PLAYLIST_LIMIT` (100), `CONCORD_NPC_KNOWLEDGE_BATCH` (1000), `CONCORD_SOCIAL_BRIDGE_BATCH` (2000), `CONCORD_FAUNA_SPAWN_BATCH` (500), `CONCORD_FEED_DTUS_PER_HOUR` (10000), `CONCORD_LLM_QUEUE_DEPTH` (1000), `CONCORD_DIALOGUE_MAX_CONCURRENT` (50), `CONCORD_DOWNLOADS_PER_USER` (25).
- `CONCORD_FEDERATION_TOKEN` — when set, federation `/api/world/social-shadows` requires Bearer auth.

---

## Architecture

### The monolith: `server/server.js`
62,000+ lines. All routes, middleware, startup, and tick logic live here. It is intentionally monolithic (comment in code: "for IP protection"). Adding new routes means adding them directly to this file. It imports from `server/lib/`, `server/emergent/`, `server/domains/`, and `server/routes/`.

### Three-gate permission system
Every frontend API call passes three gates in `server.js`:
1. **authMiddleware** — `publicReadPaths` array (path prefix allowlist for unauthenticated GET)
2. **runMacro** — `publicReadDomains` object (domain+macro allowlist)
3. **Chicken2** — `_safeReadPaths` + `safeReadBypass` boolean

### The macro system
Frontend calls `POST /api/lens/run` with `{ domain, name, input }`. This routes to `runMacro(domain, name, input, ctx)` in `server.js`. All 175 lenses expose their functionality as domain macros (e.g., `runMacro("chat", "respond", {...})`). Domain logic lives in `server/domains/<domain>.js`.

### Heartbeat tick (every 15s)
`governorTick()` in `server.js` drives all emergent simulation. Two registration patterns coexist:
- **Per-entity inline ticks** (33+ modules in `server/emergent/`) running at varying frequencies (every tick, every 5th, every 20th, etc.). See `WIRING_SPEC.md` for the full table.
- **Singleton periodic modules** (7 registered + 12 wrapped via `runHeartbeatModule`) for system-wide work — social-npc-bridge (5 ticks), npc-knowledge-bridge (10), metrics-decay (20), fauna-spawner (30), eco-expiry-sweep (5), refusal-field-sweep (1), corpse-cleanup (10), plus the wrapped ones (walker-journey, creature-bond-decay, combat-state-tick, weather-advance, npc-schedule-replan, news-log-pull, council-theater-tick, reputation-badge-sweep, citation-quest-bridge-tick, concord-link-walker-tick, world-event-scheduler-tick @ 40, world-event-finalize-tick @ 4).

Always wrap new heartbeat additions in `try/catch` — a module crash must never stop the tick. Counter `concord_heartbeat_ticks_total` (server.js:5592, alert `ConcordHeartbeatStopped` in `monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml:60`) increments per tick; rate==0 for >60s indicates the loop has frozen. Skipped ticks (when a previous tick is still running) are NOT counted — observable gap.

### DTU substrate
Discrete Thought Units are the atomic knowledge format. Four layers: `human` (readable summary), `core` (structured claims/definitions), `machine` (tags, embeddings, verifier), `artifact` (optional binary at `./data/artifacts/{dtuId}/`). Regular DTUs consolidate into MEGA (5–20 originals) then HYPER (50–200) at 33:1 compression every 30 ticks. There is **no hard DTU ceiling**; memory pressure is governed by `server/lib/memory-pressure.js` against `MAX_OLD_SPACE_SIZE`. With the 32GB-heap default the substrate comfortably holds ~1.5M DTUs.

### Five-brain architecture (four cognitive + LLaVA vision)
Default models tuned for the **NVIDIA RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell** (32GB GDDR7, 5th-gen tensor cores). Override any model via env var.

| Brain | Default model (q4_K_M) | VRAM | Port | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conscious | `qwen2.5:32b-instruct-q4_K_M` | ~18GB | 11434 | Chat, deep reasoning, council |
| Subconscious | `qwen2.5:7b-instruct-q5_K_M` | ~5GB | 11435 | Autogen, dream, synthesis |
| Utility | `qwen2.5:3b-instruct-q5_K_M` | ~2GB | 11436 | Lens actions, quick tasks (65% of requests) |
| Repair | `qwen2.5:1.5b-instruct-q5_K_M` | ~1GB | 11437 | Error detection, auto-fix |
| Vision | `llava:13b-v1.6-vicuna-q4_K_M` | ~9GB | 11438 | LLaVA — image understanding, food vision, doc layout |

All five Ollama services run with `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1` + `OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0` to use the Blackwell tensor cores and halve KV cache memory. `initFiveBrains()` probes all five (4 cognitive + 1 multimodal/vision) on startup and auto-pulls models. `ctx.llm.chat()` routes to conscious; falls back to subconscious. Vision queries route through `server/lib/vision-inference.js#callVision` which reads `BRAIN_VISION_URL` and routes via `BRAIN.multimodal` / `BRAIN_CONFIG.multimodal`.

### 175-lens frontend
`concord-frontend/app/lenses/` has 185 directories (175 lenses + system pages). Each lens page calls its backend domain macro. Lens feature specs live in `server/lib/lens-features.js` (20 universal features) and `server/lib/lens-features-extended.js` (**58 lens entries spanning lensNumber 66–123, contiguous, no duplicates** — verified by `tests/lens-features-extended.test.js`). Categories: GOVERNANCE_EXT (8), SCIENCE_EXT (6), AI_EXT (7), AI_COGNITION (10), SPECIALIZED_EXT (13), BRIDGE (1), CREATIVE (2), SPECIALIZED (11). **~30+ lenses have full production-grade implementations (chat, code, healthcare, education, dtus, marketplace, alliance, anon, atlas, attention, calendar, council, debate, eco, fractal, hypothesis, lab, legal, meta, neuro, parenting, quantum, vote, whiteboard, accounting, agriculture, photography, physics, and more).** Several remaining lenses have analysis macros that need plumbing to DTU/LLM/cross-domain reuse. Use `npm run score-lenses` to audit current implementation completeness.

### Concordia (World Lens)
3D civilization simulator inside the platform. Key directories:
- `concord-frontend/lib/world-lens/` — Three.js terrain, building, avatar, physics (28 TS files, ~428KB)
- `concord-frontend/lib/concordia/` — Gait synthesis, FABRIK IK, secondary physics, combat logic
- `concord-frontend/components/world/` — IsometricEngine, AvatarSystem3D, CombatHUD, GameJuice
- `concord-frontend/components/concordia/` — HUD, skills, dialogue, quests, world UI
- `server/lib/npc-*.js` — 11 NPC modules (simulator, behaviors, archetypes, family, gear, jobs, relations, spawning)
- `server/emergent/quest-engine.js` — In-memory quest engine (createQuest, prerequisite chains, breadcrumb protocol)
- `server/lib/oracle-brain.js` — LLM quest chain + dialogue generation
- `server/lib/narrative-bridge.js` — Enriches oracle-brain calls with authored NPC/faction context
- `server/lib/content-seeder.js` — Seeds authored world content at startup (idempotent)
- `content/world/` — Authored factions, NPCs (with backstories), lore events
- `content/quests/` — Authored quest chains (onboarding, 7-quest main arc, 8 faction quests)

### Database
SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (in `dependencies`, not optional — the server hard-requires it). Synchronous, in-process, no ORM. Migrations in `server/migrations/` (**100 migrations through `100_evo_assets_gameplay_kinds.js`**), run automatically at startup and manually via `npm run migrate`. Schema version tracked in `schema_version` table. Migration 100 (the most recent) extended `evo_assets` CHECK constraints to admit gameplay-derived kinds (`creature`, `craft`, `skill`, `drop`, `species`) — required for the gameplay-asset-bridge to actually persist events.

### Mobile
`concord-mobile/` — React Native + Expo v52. Real native app with BLE, WiFi P2P, geolocation, NFC, SQLite local store, wallet/marketplace. Not a web wrapper. Secure storage uses `expo-secure-store` (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore) on native and `WebCrypto` AES-GCM with a non-extractable key in IndexedDB on web — selected by `createSecureStorageForPlatform(Platform)` in `App.tsx`.

## Current Wiring Status (post-Concordant Web)

This section exists so future sessions don't repeat discovery work.

### Fully working end-to-end
- Auth (JWT + cookie), login/signup
- Chat system (WebSocket streaming, DTU context, web search, personality persistence)
- DTU creation, marketplace, citation royalties
- Skill progression tracking and mastery UI (combat skills via `skill:use` archive Sovereign Refusal Archive)
- Real-time world presence (spatial chunking, avatar interpolation, anti-cheat)
- World events (11 types, RSVP, DTU generation, entry fees)
- Faction/org creation, governance voting
- 3D world rendering (terrain, buildings, avatars with IK, weather, day/night)
- Content seeder + narrative bridge — seeds 24 authored NPCs (incl. Sovereign / Concord / Concordia / 5 Coalition + Web NPCs / Weaver of Echoes), 7 factions, 19 lore events, 7 hand-authored idle dialogue trees that bypass the LLM
- v2.0 recipe substrate (fighting_style_recipe / spell_recipe / blueprint), `scope='personal'` defaulting + `personal_dtus_never_leak` invariant, list-on-marketplace with tier pricing
- Social-NPC bridge — public timeline DTUs surface to NPC oracle prompts via Shadow DTUs every 5 ticks, with backend privacy gate
- Music DTU → soundscape (community tracks per district) + cross-world XP cascade
- Building blueprint → world spawn (with bounding-box overlap check + DELETE)
- Medical/research/engineering DTU → NPC knowledge (npc_knowledge table, surfaced in role-matched dialogue)
- Per-player four-axis metrics (ecosystem_score / concord_alignment / concordia_alignment / refusal_debt) with decay sweep
- Refusal Field — base-6 glyph algebra → time-bounded gates on death / harvest / hostility / consequence / numbers / dome / win, **persistent across restart** via migration 097
- Concordia (goddess) auto-selects warm/cold dialogue phase from `ecosystem_score` at the dialogue endpoint
- Mass Raid friendly-fire immunity wired into the `combat:attack` socket path
- Multi-avatar — migration 093 + `/api/avatars` CRUD + AvatarSwitcher UI; personal-locker queries scope by `avatar_id`; hotbar reads `localStorage.concordia:activeAvatarId`
- Federation export `/api/world/social-shadows` with optional `CONCORD_FEDERATION_TOKEN` Bearer auth + import pass tagged `federated_signal`
- Realtime fast-path for public timeline posts (`timeline:post` socket event) and active-effect application (`player:effect-applied`)
- DAW → soundscape ducking, world-scoped via `concordia:activeWorldId` localStorage hint
- Crafting UI lens (`/lenses/crafting`) with Mine / Browse Marketplace / Author tabs + inline tier-pricing modal + ActiveEffectsBar HUD
- Heartbeat-registry pattern — modules register at one site instead of editing `governorTick()`. Currently registered: social-npc-bridge (5), npc-knowledge-bridge (10), metrics-decay (20), fauna-spawner (30), eco-expiry-sweep (5), refusal-field-sweep (1), corpse-cleanup (10), world-event-scheduler
- World event auto-generation — `server/lib/world-event-scheduler.js` registered at `server.js:29359-29365` via heartbeat, generating recurring events on cadence
- New world lore seeding — `server/lib/content-seeder.js:36` `discoverSubWorlds()` auto-discovers any `content/world/<name>/` directory; new worlds with content seed automatically
- GameJuice receives level-up via `LevelUpJuiceBridge.tsx`; combat events via CombatHUD dispatch
- NPC click → dialogue wired: `ConcordiaScene.tsx:892` raycaster → `POST /api/worlds/:worldId/npcs/:npcId/dialogue` (`routes/worlds.js:805`) → `DialoguePanel.tsx`
- Player trade fully implemented in `server/lib/player-trade.js` (initiate/offer/ready socket flow)
- DTU auto-compression — wired inline in `governorTick` at `server.js:28970-29061`. Every `TICK_FREQUENCIES.CONSOLIDATION` (30) ticks: cluster regular DTUs into MEGAs via `runMacro("dtu","cluster")` → `runMacro("dtu","gapPromote")`, validate via `validateConsolidationQuality`, transfer edges via `transferEdgesToConsolidated`, archive sources via `demoteToArchive`, then repeat for MEGA→HYPER when MEGA population ≥ `HYPER_MIN_POPULATION` (15).
- Rapier3D collision is authoritative — `concord-frontend/lib/world-lens/physics-world.ts` integrated with `AvatarSystem3D.tsx:1565` (`physicsWorld.moveCharacter('player', ...)`); the `else` branch at `:1569` is a defensive null-check (Rapier hasn't loaded), not a bounds fallback. Y-clamp at `:1585` is terrain heightfield, not world bounds.
- Sovereign Mass Raid Phase 4 dome — backend phase `eternal` declares `dome_collapse` Refusal Field via `server/lib/sovereign/raid-event.js:32`; `concord-frontend/lib/world-lens/dome-barrier.ts` `attachDomeBarrier()` listens for `world:refusal-field` socket events and renders a shrinking transparent sphere in the scene; mounted by `ConcordiaScene.tsx`.
- EvoAsset feedback — `server/lib/evo-asset/scheduler.js` emits `evo:asset-promoted` socket event on each verified promotion (`scheduler.js:140-150`); `LevelUpJuiceBridge.tsx` subscribes and fires "Manifested fused power" toast + GameJuice fanfare.
- Glyph algebra is load-bearing — `server/lib/refusal-field.js:computeFieldComposition` composes active fields' glyphs via `glyphAdd`; `isCompoundRefusal` (strength ≥ 6) overrides ecosystem score in Concordia goddess dialogue tone selection at `server/routes/world-narrative.js`.

### Built but not yet wired to gameplay
*(Empty — all prior items shipped.)*

### Missing (needs building)
*(No code-side gaps remain. The remaining work is content authoring + UX testing — neither requires engineering.)*
- Content discovery surfaced by `concord-frontend/components/world/DistrictActivityFeed.tsx` (mounted in `app/lenses/world/page.tsx`); it aggregates `/api/world/events`, `/api/worlds/:worldId/quests/active`, `/api/tools/recipes` per proximity.
- Emote system shipped — `concord-frontend/components/world/EmoteWheel.tsx` (6 emotes) + `concord-frontend/components/concordia/social/EmoteWheel.tsx` (8 emotes with animation field) + `concord-frontend/components/world-lens/AnimationManager.tsx` (444 LOC state machine); both wheels mounted in `app/lenses/world/page.tsx`.
- First-hour onboarding shipped — `register/page.tsx` → `/onboarding`; `FirstWinWizard` mounted in `AppShell.tsx`; `/api/guidance/first-win` + `/api/onboarding/*` + `/api/tutorial/first-cycle` endpoints live; tutorial chain (cook → eat → fight → commune) authored in `content/quests/onboarding.json`. End-to-end journey covered by `server/tests/e2e/first-cycle-journey.test.js` (Tier-3 integration test).

## Key Invariants

- **Marketplace fees are hardcoded.**
  - DTU royalty-aware path (`/api/marketplace/purchaseWithRoyalties`): `creatorPool = price * 0.95`, `platformFee = price * 0.05` — 95% to creator pool.
  - Economic marketplace path (`/api/economic/marketplace/buy`): `MARKETPLACE_FEE: 0.04`, `CREATOR_SHARE: 0.70`, `ROYALTY_SHARE: 0.20`, `TREASURY_SHARE: 0.10`.
  - Token purchase fee (Stripe → Concord Coin): `TOKEN_PURCHASE_FEE: 0.0146`.
  - Creative marketplace constants (`server/lib/creative-marketplace-constants.js:422-440`): `PLATFORM_FEE_RATE 0.0146`, `MARKETPLACE_FEE_RATE 0.04`, `INITIAL_ROYALTY_RATE 0.21`, `ROYALTY_HALVING 2`, `ROYALTY_FLOOR 0.0005`, `MAX_CASCADE_DEPTH 50`.
  - Royalty cascade cap (`server/economy/royalty-cascade.js:180`): `MAX_ROYALTY_RATE = 0.30` of the sale price to ancestors. Seller always keeps ≥64.54% (100% − 5.46% fees − 30% royalty cap). Tested in `tests/royalty-cascade.test.js`.
  - **Do not change any of the above without governance approval.** They are constitutional invariants.
- **48-hour withdrawal hold.** `server/economy/withdrawals.js:23` — only credits older than `WITHDRAWAL_HOLD_HOURS = 48` are withdrawal-eligible. This is the anti-refund-exploit gate (sell → withdraw instantly → buyer refund → funds gone). Tests must seed credits with backdated `created_at` to exercise the withdrawal path.
- **Citation requires consent.** `server/economy/royalty-cascade.js:registerCitation` short-circuits with `citation_consent_not_granted` unless one of: parent DTU is public/published/global-scoped, parent creator toggled `allow_citation`, OR caller holds a purchased usage license. Tests must pass `parentDtu: { visibility: "public" }` or `hasPurchasedLicense: true` to exercise downstream cycle/persistence logic.
- **Heartbeat modules must never throw.** Always wrap in `try/catch`.
- **DTU originals are tombstoned by the forgetting-engine retention pathway** (`server/emergent/forgetting-engine.js:134, 155`), preserving lineage. The user-initiated `dtu:deleted` event hard-deletes; do not extend hard-delete paths to retention sweeps.
- **NPC secrets (narrative_context.secret) must not be passed to LLM prompts.** They are for human authors and branch conditions only. The narrative bridge enforces this at `server/lib/narrative-bridge.js:147`.
- **DTU consolidation is automatic** via inline pipeline in `governorTick` at `server.js:28970-29061` (every `TICK_FREQUENCIES.CONSOLIDATION = 30` ticks). Forms MEGAs from regular DTU clusters (size 5–20), then HYPERs from MEGA clusters (size 3–10) once MEGA population ≥ 15. Constants at `server.js:1399-1419`. Manual `compressToDMega()` / `compressToHyper()` (`server/economy/dtu-pipeline.js:326, 399`) still callable from macros.
- **Refusal Field glyph algebra is load-bearing.** `server/lib/refusal-field.js:applyTemporaryRefusal` (lines 59–76) computes a real per-entry glyph from `computeBase6Layer` + `glyphDiv`; `computeFieldComposition` accumulates them via `glyphAdd` (lines 175–222) and returns a `strength` numeric. Callers MUST branch on `strength >= 6` (`isCompoundRefusal`) for compound-refusal mechanics: Concordia goddess "deep cold" dialogue tone (`server/routes/world-narrative.js`), world-event suspension, and the dome-collapse Mass Raid phase (`server/lib/sovereign/raid-event.js`). Strength is hard-capped at 9. The May 2026 audit fixed two latent bugs that had silently kept `composedFrom` at 0 (calls to `.value` on objects that don't have one); regression tests live at `tests/refusal-algebra/strength-gating.test.js`. Time-bounded gates from the `FIELD_KINDS` table (death/harvest/hostility/consequence/numbers/dome/win) ALSO still enforce per-kind blocks via `isRefused()`.
- Migrations are append-only. Never modify an existing migration file.
- `CONCORD_NO_LISTEN=true` + `NODE_ENV=test` both suppress port binding for tests.
- The frontend `build` script runs `prophet-check` (repair cortex pre-build analysis) before `next build`. Build blockers will exit 1.

## Multi-tenant cap defaults (lifted from single-user pre-deploy)

Several caps were intentionally raised before multi-tenant deploy. If you find a test asserting the old value, the test is stale — update to the new default.

| Constant | Old | New | Env override |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAX_DOMAIN_SIGNALS` (`server/lib/session-context-accumulator.js:29`) | 50 | **500** | `CONCORD_DOMAIN_SIGNALS` |
| `MAX_ACTIVE_LENSES` (same file:30) | 15 | **175** | `CONCORD_ACTIVE_LENSES` |
| `MAX_SESSION_HISTORY` (same file:28) | 30 | **300** | `CONCORD_SESSION_HISTORY` |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS_PER_USER` (`server/lib/storage-constants.js:210`) | 5 | **25** | `CONCORD_DOWNLOADS_PER_USER` |
| `SESSION_LIMITS.MAX_CONCURRENT` (`server/emergent/schema.js:98`) | 5 | **50** | `CONCORD_DIALOGUE_MAX_CONCURRENT` |
| `MAX_ARCHIVED_SUMMARIES` (`server/lib/conversation-summarizer.js:26`) | 20 | **200** | `CONCORD_ARCHIVED_SUMMARIES` |

## Test suite

- `npm test` runs `node --test --test-force-exit --test-timeout=30000 'tests/**/*.test.js' 'tests/**/*-tests.js' && npm run test:behavior`
- Current state (May 2026 audit pass): **9498 main + 1223 behavior = 10,721 passing, 0 failing.**
- Tier-1 behavior harness (`tests/behavior/lens-behavior-smoke.behavior.js`) auto-derives one test per (domain, macro) from the live `MACROS` map; skips LLM-hint and destructive-hint macros (run with `CONCORD_BEHAVIOR_TEST_LLM=true` to include).
- Tier-2 contract tests pin load-bearing math (royalty cascade, DTU quality scoring, refusal-field strength gating, world-event scheduler cadence).
- Tier-3 E2E covers the cook → eat → fight → commune onboarding journey (`tests/e2e/first-cycle-journey.test.js`).
- `npm install` in `server/` is mandatory before first run — the codebase hard-requires `better-sqlite3`, `express`, `jsonwebtoken`, `yaml`, `uuid`. All declared in `package.json`; no native build dependencies on RTX-class boxes.

## Adding a New Lens

1. Create `server/domains/<name>.js` with exported macro handlers
2. Add domain to `server/lib/lens-manifest.js` and `server/lib/lens-features.js`
3. Create `concord-frontend/app/lenses/<name>/page.tsx`
4. Add route to `server.js` if the lens needs custom endpoints beyond the macro system
5. Run `npm run validate-routes` and `npm run score-lenses` to verify consistency

## Adding a Heartbeat Module

1. Implement module in `server/emergent/<module>.js`
2. Register in `server/emergent/module-registry.js`
3. Wire into `governorTick` in `server.js` at the appropriate tick frequency
4. Run `npm run check-deps` to validate no circular dependencies introduced
